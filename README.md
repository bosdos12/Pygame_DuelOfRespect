# Pygame_DuelOfRespect
This is my second ever pygame project, a classic platform based, local 2 player-style 2d shooter game!

Controls:
# Player 1 / Yellow:
up - w | left - a | down - s | right - d | fire - left_control or space | reload - left_shift

# Player 2 / Red:
up - ⬆️ | left - ⬅️ | down - ⬇️ | right - ➡️ | fire - right_control | reload - right_shift

# SIDENOTE - THIS CODE IS BASICALLY JUNK, I JUST STARTED LEARNING PYGAME 2 DAYS AGO SO STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND GAME-DEV WRITING ARCHITECTURE!
